**in_voltageX_en / in_voltageX-voltageY_en / timestamp_en:**
Scan element control for triggered data capture.
Writing 1 will enable the scan element, writing 0 will disable it

**in_voltageX_type / in_voltageX-voltageY_type / timestamp_type:**
Description of the scan element data storage within the buffer
and therefore in the form in which it is read from user-space.
Form is [s|u]bits/storage-bits. s or u specifies if signed
(2's complement) or unsigned. bits is the number of bits of
data and storage-bits is the space (after padding) that it
occupies in the buffer. Note that some devices will have
additional information in the unused bits so to get a clean
value, the bits value must be used to mask the buffer output
value appropriately. The storage-bits value also specifies the
data alignment. So u12/16 will be a unsigned 12 bit integer
stored in a 16 bit location aligned to a 16 bit boundary.
For other storage combinations this attribute will be extended
appropriately.

**in_voltageX_index / in_voltageX-voltageY_index / timestamp_index:**
A single positive integer specifying the position of this
scan element in the buffer. Note these are not dependent on
what is enabled and may not be contiguous. Thus for user-space
to establish the full layout these must be used in conjunction
with all _en attributes to establish which channels are present,
and the relevant _type attributes to establish the data storage
format.
