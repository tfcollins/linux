===== Description =====

==== Capacitance Touch Sensors ====

Capacitance sensors detect a change in capacitance when something or someone approaches or touches the sensor. The technique has been used in industrial applications for many years to measure liquid levels, humidity, and material composition. A newer application, coming into widespread use, is in human-to-machine interfaces. Mechanical buttons, switches, and jog wheels have long been used as the interface between the user and the machine. Because of their many drawbacks, however, interface designers have been increasingly looking for more reliable solutions. Capacitive sensors can be used in the same manner as buttons, but they also can function with greater versatility, for example, when implementing a 128-position scroll bar.

For more info on how these types of sensors work, take a peek at the [[adi>library/analogDialogue/archives/40-10/cap_sensors.html|ADI web site]].


==== Overview ====

Implementing a capacitive touch sensor solution using the AD714x requires three components: 
  * the AD714x capacitive-to-digital converter IC, 
  * sensors on a PCB or Flex Circuit, 
  * software to communicate with the AD714x.

The sensor traces can be any number of different shapes and sizes. Buttons, wheels, scroll-bar, joypad, and touchpad shapes can be laid out as traces on the sensor PCB.

Many options for implementing the user interface are available to the designer, ranging from simply replacing mechanical buttons with capacitive button sensors to eliminating buttons by using a joypad with eight output positions, or a scroll wheel that gives 128 output positions.

The number of sensors that can be implemented using a single device depends on the type of sensors required. The AD7142 has 14 capacitance input pins and 12 conversion channels, the AD7143 and AD7148 have 8 capacitance input pins and 8 conversion channels, and the AD7147 and AD7147A have 13 capacitance input pins and 12 conversion channels.

In Linux, there are three driver modules for the AD714x:
linux-2.6.x/drivers/input/misc/ad714x.c
linux-2.6.x/drivers/input/misc/ad714x-spi.c
linux-2.6.x/drivers/input/misc/ad714x-i2c.c.

ad714x.c fulfills the common arithmetic and state machines for sliders, keypads, touchpads and so on. ad714x-spi.c and ad714x-i2c.c, which call common probe/remove entries in ad714x.c, merge the bottom ad714x driver into Linux SPI/I2C device driver framework. The code included works with the AD7142 and AD7147 demo board.
Note that this code is covered under the GPL - if you want non-GPL source, have a look at ADI's Web site.

====== Adding Linux driver support ======

To select it from menuconfig:

<code>
Device Drivers  --->
  Input device support  --->
   [*]   Miscellaneous devices  --->
    <*>   Analog Devices AD714x Capacitance Touch Sensor
       <*>     support I2C bus connection
       <*>     support SPI bus connection
</code>

====== Hardware configuration ======

{{:software:driver:linux:ad7142_schematic.jpg?800|}}

We connected the AD7142 demo board to the TWI/I2C connector and AD7147 demo board to the SPI connector on the BF537 STAMP board.

{{:software:driver:linux:ad7142_stamp537.jpg|}}

For BF537 STAMP board, please set SW5-3 off as the interrupt input.

And For AD7147 eval-board, please set S4-2 on and other positions off.
